Utilising geospatial analysis methods as well as geographic information systems, we aim to derive potential suitable sites for the new capital city after taking into account important factors that should be considered when choosing the optimal location of a capital city. We believe that performing a geospatial analysis ensures a more informed decision-making process which is extremely important considering the outcome could greatly affect the prosperity of Indonesia and the lives of many Indonesians.\r\nProject Objective\r\nTask 1\r\nPrepare a report of survey to be submitted to the National Development Agency including data relating to\r\nPopulation and Demographic\r\nEconomic and Businesses\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\nTask 2\r\nSelect a suitable site for the proposed new capital city using the criteria below:\r\n4500 to 5500 hectares in size\r\nFlat lands preferred\r\nFar away from potential natural disaster risk areas\r\nClose proximity to existing urban settlement areas\r\nAvoid natural forests\r\nAvoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\nHighly accessible (road transport, airports and seaports)\r\nStudy Area\r\nFor this project, we will be looking at the East Kalimantan Province and it’s cities - Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara.\r\n\r\nScope of Work\r\nThis list is not exhaustive:\r\nSelection of project area, this year the project area is provided.\r\nData collection, extraction, integration, transformation and wrangling.\r\nDesigning and building GIS model and database\r\nPreparing report of survey\r\nPerforming site suitability analysis by integrating GIS and multi-criteria evaluation methods.\r\nPreparing site suitability analysis report including detail discussion of the analysing method used.\r\nPreparing poster and project webpage.\r\nProject Timeline\r\n\r\nData Source\r\n\r\nData source\r\nData Format\r\nDescription\r\nLink\r\nindonesia-geospasial.com\r\nShapefiles\r\nBatas Desa & Data Kependudukan Tahun 2019 Seluruh Indonesia\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html\r\nindonesia-geospasial.com\r\nShapefiles\r\nRBI Provinsi Kalimantan Timur Perwilayah (Kabupaten/Kota)\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html\r\nindonesia-geospasial.com\r\nTIF Files\r\nDEM SRTM 30m, digital elevation model at 30m resolution\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/download-dem-srtm-30-meter-se-indonesia.html\r\nindonesia-geospasial.com\r\nShapefiles\r\nGeological data layer\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/03/download-data-shapefile-shp-geologi-se.html\r\nindonesia-geospasial.com\r\nShapefiles\r\nForest fire hot spot data\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/shapefile-shp-titik-api-hotspot.html\r\nindonesia-geospasial.com\r\nShapefiles\r\nBuildings and Settlements\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/12/download-shp-pemukiman-detail-seluruh.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\r\n\r\nThrough a press conference held in Jakarta in 2019, Indonesia’s President, President Joko Widodo, announced the plan to move Indonesia’s capital from Jakarta on the Java island to the East Kalimantan province on the Kalimantan island. It was determined after extensive research that the new capital would be built in part of two regencies in East Kalimantan province: Penajam Paser Utara regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency.\r\nThe move is said to be part of a strategic plan to relieve the strain on Jakarta and Java island which has been facing serious congestion and environmental issues over the last decade. This is attributed to the fact that the island houses close to 60% of the Indonesian population (that is close to 164 million people) and is responsible for more than 50% of the country’s economic activity (Lyons, 2019). On top of these reasons, the most deciding factor for the move is the fact that Jakarta is sinking. Approximately 40% of the city lies below sea level and it continues sinking at a rate of 20cm per year. This has resulted in devastating floods of up to 3m deep yearly, resulting in the displacement of 170,000 people. While the decision to relocate the capital city was not an easy one, it was crucial to prevent the state of Jakarta from worsening further.\r\nThere are many reasons why East Kalimantan, more precisely the area in part of Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara regency was chosen as the ideal location to build the capital city. This area is in close proximity to two of the most major cities in East Kalimantan - Kota Balikpapan and Kota Samarinda. Hence, the economic activity in this area is already thriving, which provides a good foundation to build Indonesia’s new centre of economy. Furthermore, the site has minimal risks of natural disasters such as flooding, earthquake and volcanic eruptions. The site is also strategically at the centre of Indonesia, making the new capital city a truly accessible centre of development in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
