# <span style="font-family:DM Sans;color:#2E6173;font-size:1.5em;">Title: Finding Capital City</span>

![](logo.png)

## <span style="font-family:DM Sans;color:#2E6173;font-size:1em;">Project Summary</span>
Our team is looking at proposing a site for the new capital city based on the accessibility, land suitability, safety (far away from disaster prone areas) while reducing environmental damage and cost.  

## <span style="font-family:DM Sans;color:#2E6173;font-size:1em;">Project Proposal</span>

### <span style="font-family:DM Sans;color:#2E6173;font-size:0.8em;">Motivation of Project</span>
The goal of this project is to determine the suitable site of the new capital city in the predetermined area that is in part of Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara regency. Utilising geospatial analysis methods as well as geographic information systems, we aim to derive potential suitable sites for the new capital city after taking into account important factors that should be considered when choosing the optimal location of a capital city. We believe that performing a geospatial analysis ensures a more informed decision-making process which is extremely important considering the outcome could greatly affect the prosperity of Indonesia and the lives of many Indonesians.  

### <span style="font-family:DM Sans;color:#2E6173;font-size:0.8em;">Project Objective</span>

* 4500 to 5500 hectares in size
* Flat lands preferred 
* Far away from potential natural disaster risk areas
* Close proximity to existing urban settlement areas
* Avoid natural forests
